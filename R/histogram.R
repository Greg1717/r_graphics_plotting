## Extreme outliers; the "FD" rule would take very large number of 'breaks':
XXL <- c(1:9, c(-1,1)*1e300)
hh <- hist(XXL, "FD") # did not work in R <= 3.4.1; now gives warning
## pretty() determines how many counts are used (platform dependently!):
length(hh$breaks) ## typically 1 million -- though 1e6 was "a suggestion only"

## R >= 4.2.0: no "*.5" labels on y-axis:
hist(c(2,3,3,5,5,6,6,6,7))

require(stats)
set.seed(14)
x <- rchisq(100, df = 4)

## Histogram with custom x-axis:
hist(x, xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = 0:17)


## Comparing data with a model distribution should be done with qqplot()!
qqplot(x, qchisq(ppoints(x), df = 4)); abline(0, 1, col = 2, lty = 2)

## if you really insist on using hist() ... :
hist(x, freq = FALSE, ylim = c(0, 0.2))
curve(dchisq(x, df = 4), col = 2, lty = 2, lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

# plot.histogram ==============================================================

plot(wwt, border = "dark blue", col = "light blue",
     main = "Histogram of 15 women's weights", xlab = "weight [pounds]")

## Fake "lines" example, using non-default labels:
w2 <- wwt; w2$counts <- w2$counts - 1
lines(w2, col = "Midnight Blue", labels = ifelse(w2$counts, "> 1", "1"))
